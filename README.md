# 🌌 Hey there, I'm Alexandra!

Astrophysicist and data explorer — I use observational data to map galaxies and dark matter in our Universe,  
and I’m orbiting into data science, deep learning, and AI along the way.

🪐 I like making sense of noisy universes — cosmic or otherwise.  
💫 Here I share both my astrophysics projects and my personal experiments as I explore data closer to home: real-world datasets and practical AI/ML challenges.

### 🧭 What you'll find here
- 🌌 Cosmic projects: galaxy data analysis, modeling and statistical methods, and creating pretty visualizations of the universe  
- 🌍 Earthly projects: applying machine learning, deep learning, and data science to real-world datasets  

### ☕ About me
- 📍 Based in Seoul, South Korea  
- 🎓 PhD in Astrophysics 
- 🧩 Always learning — Python, AI, and how to make plots look cooler than they need to be
